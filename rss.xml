    <description>
      This project proposes a podcast that explores the epistemology of design through a dialogue generated by artificial intelligence, inviting reflection on the roles of knowledge, creativity, and technology. Each episode addresses a key theme of design, explored through the interplay of two synthetic voices embodying complementary and divergent philosophical perspectives. The choice of artificial intelligence as a conversational partner reflects a central question: To what extent can machines contribute to the creation and transmission of knowledge, and how does their ability to simulate human thought raise new epistemological questions?
      The podcast becomes an experiment in which design is not merely the production of objects but a philosophical and cognitive act that interrogates the dynamics between humanity and artificial intelligence. In this context, the use of artificial intelligence goes beyond replicating human thought, offering a critical reflection on the nature of creativity. It invites the listener to consider whether machine-generated thought can be regarded as authentic thinking or if it remains a mere simulation of a reality it does not truly possess.

      <title>Episode 1: The Architecture of Complexity</title>
      <description>
        Herbert Simon's 1962 paper, "The Architecture of Complexity," explores the prevalence and implications of hierarchical structures in complex systems across diverse fields. The paper argues that hierarchical organization facilitates the rapid evolution of complex systems by providing stable intermediate forms. Simon introduces the concept of "near decomposability," where interactions within subsystems are stronger than those between them, simplifying analysis and description. This near decomposability is linked to the comprehensibility of complex systems, as it allows for simplified representations. The paper further examines how hierarchical structures relate to problem-solving, self-reproduction, and the development of organisms, suggesting that process descriptions, rather than state descriptions, are crucial for understanding these complex processes.
